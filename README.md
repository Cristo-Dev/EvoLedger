## EvoLedge - The Klaytn RWA Factory

### Vision

The current bottleneck for RWAs on Klaytn lies in discovering which markets and assets are ready to move on-chain. To help this discovery, we simplified the RWA tokenization process, and thus give users and developers a template marketplace for RWAs on Klaytn - decentralized and generalized for any RWA.

### Our BUIDL

Our project simplifies the way real-world assets (RWAs) are tokenized and traded, leveraging smart contracts on the Klaytn blockchain. At the heart of our project is a vision to streamline the transition of various markets onto the blockchain, identifying and targeting those with the greatest potential for digital transformation.

Our platformâ€™s business logic runs completely on solidity smart contracts, and users interact with it through a Next.js UI. We aimed to make our platform easily forkable, and thus used a modern tech stack that easily integrates with the most used frameworks and APIs.

Our users are empowered to create collections of their real-world assets, which are then verified and priced by trusted verifiers - similar to local real estate markets. These assets are tokenized into tradable units, fostering a new marketplace where tokens can be traded, listed, and even used to form Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) around the assets.

Our project is more than just a marketplace; it's a template and a stepping stone towards the larger goal of bringing the vast world of Real-World Assets onto the blockchain, making their trade more accessible, secure, and transparent. We envision a future where the exchange of Real-World Assets is as seamless and straightforward as trading digital assets today.
